            <Typography>Trying a new thing is fun. New technologies, new ideas. I love to work with versatility. At a very early age at my university, I worked with several things. Firstly I was working with robotics, then with graphics design, and then designing game assets and animation, etc. My final year's project was developing a First-Person Shooting game. I worked as an asset designer in this team. I love learning about new technologies. Now I start learning Networking related staff. Cisco Routing-Switching, Mikrotik Routing. For almost two years, I worked as a network engineer in an Internet service provider(ISP). Recently, I start working with web development, </Typography>
