JavaScripts&rsquo; syntax is inspired by Java And C language. A programmer can work with object prototypes, instead of classes and that&rsquo;s why JavaScript supports OOP. And Lastly JavaScript also supports functional programming. JavaScripts&rsquo; type diagram looks more like this:</p><ol><li  class=\"list\">Number</li><li  class=\"list\">String</li><li  class=\"list\">Boolean</li><li  class=\"list\">Object</li><li  class=\"list\">Symbol</li><li  class=\"list\">Undefined</li><li  class=\"list\">Null.</li></ol><p  class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Variable:</strong></p><p  class=\"paragraph\">In JavaScript, we can declare a variable by using these three keywords.</p>    <ol><li  class=\"list\">let</li><li  class=\"list\">var</li><li  class=\"list\">const</li></ol><p  class=\"paragraph\">When you using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">&lsquo;&rsquo;let&rsquo;&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;keyword it allows you to declare block-level variables.

Because there are some similarities between C and JavaScript.</p> <p  class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">&ldquo;if-else&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>conditionals can be used in JavaScript. You want to print a age message and you set if age is less than 10, print a message &ldquo;child&rdquo; message, if not, but age is less than 20, print a &ldquo;adult&rdquo; message, otherwise a &ldquo;old&rdquo;:</p> <img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/if-else.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p  class=\"paragraph\">JavaScript has&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">&ldquo;while-do while&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>loop.

    "details": "<p class=\"paragraph\">Every language has some primitives types. And JavaScript also has some. There are six primitives types in JS.</p><ol><li  class=\"list\">String</li><li  class=\"list\">Number</li><li  class=\"list\">Undefined</li><li  class=\"list\">Null</li><li  class=\"list\">Boolean</li><li  class=\"list\">Symbol</li></ol><p  class=\"paragraph\">That’s important to know about the primitives types. Because it helps a lot to understand the language.</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/guide-to-javascript/first.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Expressions</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">JavaScript&rsquo;s language syntax recognizes expressions and statements. Both are different and we should need to know the basic difference.<br>An expression is a code that evaluates the value and a statemnet is a code that performs</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/guide-to-javascript/second.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Checking a type of value:</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">: Who are you?</p><p class=\"paragraph\">:: My name is Bond. James Bond.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">If you ask you will get an answer. Just you need to ask. JavaScript is a good boy. If you ask him &ldquo;What type of value is that?&rdquo;. He will give you the answer. Just you need to know how to ask. So, we will use Expressions called typeof. And obviously, he will give you the answer.</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/guide-to-javascript/third.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Error Handling:</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">:: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a robot&rdquo;.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">This is the most annoying exam to prove that I&rsquo;m a human being. So I&rsquo;m a human being. I make mistakes. Sometimes I find those mistakes and try to solve it. But When I&rsquo;m a programmer, maybe I make mistakes, but every time I need to find it and solve it. In JavaScript, Mr. Finder will help us to find the error.&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">try..catch&nbsp;</strong>our Mr.Finder in JavaScript. By using this syntax the error can be handle.</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/guide-to-javascript/fourth.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\">try will run the code, if there is no error then catch block will ignore otherwise catch block will execute.Some note about&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">try..catch</strong></p><ol><li  class=\"list\">This will work only when the script is valid.</li><li  class=\"list\">This syntax must be used inside a function</li></ol><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Coding Style:</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">A beautiful road can help you to walk a mile. A beautiful environment can make your mind fresh. An organized table can increase your learning willing. Beautification is everything.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Beautification in programming is also important. When we write a code we need to try to make it clear, fresh. There are no fixed rules to maintain the way to beautify a code. But if we follow some steps and ideas that can help another programmer to understand the functionality.</p><ol><li  class=\"list\">No space between the function name and parentheses between the parentheses and the parameter.</li> <li  class=\"list\">A space between parameters</li> <li  class=\"list\">Curly brace { } on the same line, after space.</li> <li  class=\"list\">Indentation 2 space for the new line after the function</li> <li  class=\"list\">Space after statement</li><li  class=\"list\">Use semicolon is mandatory</li><li  class=\"list\">An empty line between logical blocks</li> <li  class=\"list\">Spaces around a nested call</li></ol> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Comments in code:</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">Imagine yourself in an area without a nameplate, without holding, without a location card. How do you feel? No good.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Or imagine that you write 1000 lines of code the whole night, and after that night when you open your code you don&rsquo;t know which function is used for what operation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">Or imagine your junior developer messaged you to help him out from an error in his code. But when you open the code you cant understand that what is used for what operation.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">So, what is the solution?&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">Comments.&nbsp;</strong>Basically, comments use to describe how and why the code works. how to comment? when we comment a single line it starting with // and for multiline we use this /* &hellip; */. Keyboard shortcuts&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">ctrl+/</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">ECMAScript or ES6</strong></p>  <p class=\"paragraph\">ES6 alludes to form 6 of the ECMA Script programming language. ECMA Script is the normalized name for JavaScript. It was released in 2011. it represents a scripting language specification called ECMAScript.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">After ES6 is released we can declare the variable with&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">let&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">const. const</strong>&nbsp;are values that can be characterized just a single time. And&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">let&nbsp;</strong>is work like&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">var</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">const pi= 3.1416; //constant</p>  <p class=\"paragraph\">let x = &lsquo;&ldquo;hello&rdquo;;</p><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Arrow Function in ES6:</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">ES6 introduced arrow function in JS. For a lot of opportunity I personally like the new feature of ES6 is arrow function. There are two significant advantages of utilizing Arrow functions. One is that it&rsquo;s a more limited syntax and hence requires less code. It cant be used in all situation.</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/guide-to-javascript/sixth.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">How JavaScript Run</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">JavaScript is what is known as a Client-side Scripting Language. That implies that it is a PC programming language that runs inside an Internet program. The manner in which JavaScript works is interesting. Inside a typical Web page you place some JavaScript code . At the point when the program stacks the page, the program has a built-in interpreter that peruses the JavaScript code it finds in the page and runs it.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">JavaScript is divided into two memory in it</p><ol><li  class=\"list\">Heap Memory,</li><li  class=\"list\">Stack Memory</li></ol><p class=\"paragraph\">Memory Heap is where the memory allocation happens. Call Stack is where your stack frames are as your code executes</p>"

    "details": "<p class=\"paragraph\">Facebook recently launched their new interface. Which is nice and attractive. As a user, I think it&rsquo;s good. Because ultimately user experience is the main priority for web designers or web developers. Why we are talking about Facebook???</p><p class=\"paragraph\">React is created by Facebook. And React is a User Interface library. Many of us are confused about the library and framework. Just set it to your mind that React is a Library, not Framework.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">Now make it clear that what is Library and what is Framework!!</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/start-react/lvF.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Library&nbsp;</strong>is a set of reusable functions used by a computer program. And&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">Framework&nbsp;</strong>is a piece of code that builds the architect of your project. You can call your library but your framework can call you.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">ReactJS is a Library of JavaScript and AngularJS is a framework of JavaScript.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">What is JSX?</strong></p> <p class=\"paragraph\">const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, React!&lt;/h1&gt;;</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">Wait a sec!! what is that? Using HTML tag line in a variable? Yes!!! This funny but useful thing is called JSX. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. React doesn&rsquo;t need utilizing JSX, yet a great many people think that it&rsquo;s supportive as a visual guide when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It likewise permits React to show more valuable error and warning messages. Understand that thing with an example.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">We declare a variable called message and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p><p class=\"paragraph\">const message = &ldquo;Hello, React! &ldquo;;<br>const element = &lt;h1&gt; {message }&lt;/h1&gt;;</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">VDOM(Virtual DOM)</strong></p>  <p class=\"paragraph\">Before going to VDOM, let&rsquo;s talk about DOM. DOM means Document Object Model. When a web page is loaded, the browser makes a&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">D</strong>ocument&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">O</strong>bject&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">M</strong>odel of the page.</p> <img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/start-react/dom.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"><p class=\"paragraph\">A Web page is a document. This document can be either shown in the program window or as the HTML source. Be that as it may, it is a similar document in the two cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) speaks to that equivalent document so it tends to be controlled. The DOM is an object-situated portrayal of the site page, which can be altered with a scripting language, for example, JavaScript.</p>  <p class=\"paragraph\">DOM control is the core of the advanced, intuitive web. It is slower than most JavaScript activities. To address this issue, the individuals at React promoted something many refer to as the virtual DOM.</p><p class=\"paragraph\">How does it work? When JSX render every single virtual DOM object gets updated. When the virtual DOM has been updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM which one is previously-stored before the update. Comparing between new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out<em class=\"ack\">&nbsp;</em>which virtual DOM objects have changed. This process is called &ldquo;diffing.&rdquo;</p><img src=\"/Assets/Images/Blog/start-react/vdom.png\" style=\"max-width:462px; width:100%\"> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Some Fact About React</strong></p><ol><li class=\"list\">It&rsquo;s not a framework# React is not a framework, Its a library of JavaScript</li><li class=\"list\">Its JavaScript# To generate markup dynamically in React you also use JS.</li><li class=\"list\">JSX# You can simplify your code with JSX</li><li class=\"list\">Declarative # In React you use declarative style to write your components</li> <li class=\"list\">State# We talk about static data passed down the components tree. But we can use Stateful components.</li></ol> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">How To install React?</strong></p> <p class=\"paragraph\">Start a project with React is actually very easy. Just execute some command in command promote or VS code terminal. If we want we can create a project file. Then if you want to create a project with VS code follows the steps:</p> <ol> <li class=\"list\">Open VS code</li> <li class=\"list\">Select the &ldquo;File&rdquo; option from the menu bar.</li><li class=\"list\">Select the &ldquo;Open Folder&rdquo; option from File.</li> <li class=\"list\">Create a folder or if you already create a folder then click and open it.</li> <li class=\"list\">Open Terminal</li> <li class=\"list\">In terminal write-&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">npx create-react-app my-app</strong>(app name here instead of my-app) it will take some time to prepare.</li>  <li class=\"list\">Go through the created React project folder. Type&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">cd &lt;folder name&gt;&nbsp;</strong>and enter.</li><li class=\"list\">After completing this step just go to the created folder and type in terminal&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">npm start</strong></li><li class=\"list\">It will open in your browser with&nbsp; https://localhost.3000 </li></ol> <p class=\"paragraph\">The basic configuration is ready to explore now.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Optimizing Performance</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes you face some problems like the web page work slowly or render data slowly. In that case, we need to optimize our performance. React. React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI.</p><ol> <li class=\"list\">Use production build</li><li class=\"list\">Use&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">npm run build</strong></li> <li class=\"list\">Single file build</li> <li class=\"list\">Install the&nbsp;<strong class=\"strong\">terser-brunch</strong>&nbsp;plugin</li><li class=\"list\">Rollup production build</li> </ol> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Context</strong></p> <p class=\"paragraph\">In an app maybe we need to pass data from one component to another. This can be awkward for specific kinds of props that are needed by numerous segments inside an application. But Context makes this work easy. Context gives an approach to share esteems like these between components without having to expressly go a prop through each level of the tree.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Handle Event</strong></p> <p class=\"paragraph\">On a web page, we see many types of user interaction, like mouse hover, mouse click, keyboard enter, and others. The handling event on DOM and Handling event on React is quite similar. But there is some syntax difference in react handling.</p><ol> <li class=\"list\">Using camelCase, rather than lowercase in react.</li> <li class=\"list\">Pass a function as an event handler.</li></ol><p class=\"paragraph\">&lt;button onClick={clickHandler}&gt;</p> <p class=\"paragraph\">Click on me &lt;/button&gt;</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">React Hook</strong></p> <p class=\"paragraph\">In React 16.8 Hook introduces. It&rsquo;s very useful for development. Hooks unravel a wide assortment of apparently detached issues in React. It&rsquo;s difficult to reuse stateful logic between components. But React allows you to reuse stateful logic without changing your components. React allows you to use more of React&rsquo;s features without using too many classes. Hooks are capacities that let you &ldquo;hook into&rdquo; React state and lifecycle highlights from work components. State Hook and Effect Hook are very useful hooks.</p> <p class=\"paragraph\"><strong class=\"strong\">Hook rules</strong></p><p class=\"paragraph\">Hooks are JavaScript functions, yet you have to keep two principles when utilizing them.</p><ol> <li class=\"list\">Only Call Hook at the top level.</li><li class=\"list\">Only Call Hook from React function.</li> </ol>"
